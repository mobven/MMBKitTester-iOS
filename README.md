# MMBKit Test Application
Sample application for demonstrating MMBKit. All Modules integrated with SPM.

## Getting Started
Check the branch, is it develop or not. For running the app you need the add 'Frameworks' folder to base index; if folder isn't exist then create it. Then you need the add frameworks in to the 'Frameworks' folder via https://mobven.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MMBKIT/pages/466550853/Getting+Started
After that you need the install pods then run the project...:)

### Warning:
If Xcode crashes because of cryptoswift framework, you need the delete framework from Projects -> Swift Packages and then add the framework again.
